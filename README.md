These are some Jupyter Notebooks containing computation experiments with film
that are part of MITH's [Film Lab 2](https://storify.com/film_lab2/film-lab-2-african-american-history-from-the-umd-c)
symposium.

To use the notebooks first install
[anaconda3](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) it'll make installing
dependencies like numpy a lot easier.

Now open your terminal and git clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/umd-mith/filmstudy
cd filmstudy
```

Get the File Lab videos and put them in the videos directory. Email
[Oliver](mailto:ogaycken@umd.edu) to get the low-down on where the video files
can be downloaded from.

Then create an Anaconda environment:

`% conda env create -f environment.yml`

Activate it:

`% source activate filmstudy`

Start the notebook!

`% jupyter notebook`
